   *     node, based on the content of the response
   * @param timeout The timeout until the returned future fails if no response is received.
   * @return a future carrying the response that was accepted or null in case no memory is currently
   *     available to allocate the request. Can complete exceptionally in failure cases such as
   *     timeout.
