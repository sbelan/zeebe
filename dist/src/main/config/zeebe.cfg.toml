# Zeebe broker configuration file

# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# Default values:
#
# When the default value is used for a configuration option, the option is
# commented out. You can learn the default value from this file

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with K = Kilobytes, M = Megabytes or G = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16M" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 1.2, 3.56, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the
# broker.

# ----------------------------------------------------

# Controls the number of nodes this broker waits for until doing bootstrapping:
#
# * When using a single-node cluster, the value should be 1
# * When using a multi-node cluster, one node should be configured with
#   bootstrap = 3 (or 5, depending on the cluster size) and for all the other
#   nodes it should be set to 0 (or removed from the configuration since default
#   value is 0).
#
# (Note that the broker includes itself in the count, ie. when specifying '1',
# the broker waits for itself.)
#
# Explanation: When doing bootstrapping, the broker ensures that internally used
# resources such as the 'internal-system' topic are available. The
# 'internal-system' topic is used for storing information about all the other,
# user-defined, topics that are available in the cluster. When specifying a
# value > 1 for this configuration property, the broker will wait for the
# specified number of nodes to appear in the cluster and then create the
# internal-system topic if not yet present, using the specified value as
# replication factor.
bootstrap = 1

# Topics defined below are created automatically during bootstrapping.
# You can configure them as follows:
# * name: the topic name, e.g. "default-topic"
# * partitions: the number of partitions that should be created for this topic, e.g. 1
# * replicationFactor: the number of nodes this on which the partitions should be replicated, e.g. 3
#                      the replication factor cannot be greater than the number of nodes in the
#                      cluster.
[[topics]]
name = "default-topic"
partitions = 1
replicationFactor = 1

[network]

# This section contains the network configuration. Particularly, it allows to
# configure the hosts and ports the broker should bind to. the broker exposes 3
# ports: 1. client: the port on which client (Java, CLI, Go, ...) connections
# are handled 2. management: used internally by the cluster for the gossip
# membership protocol and other management interactions 3. replication: used
# internally by the cluster for replicating data across nodes using the raft
# protocol

# Controls the default host the broker should bind to. Can be overwritten on a
# per binding basis for client, management and replication
# host = "0.0.0.0"

# If a port offset is set it will be added to all ports specified in the config
# or the default values. This is a shortcut to not always specifying every port.
#
# The offset will be added to the second last position of the port, as Zeebe
# requires multiple ports. As example a portOffset of 5 will increment all ports
# by 50, i.e. 26500 will become 26550 and so on.
#
# This setting can also be overridden using the environment variable ZEEBE_PORT_OFFSET.
# portOffset = 0

# Controls the default size of the buffers that are used for buffering outgoing
# messages. Can be overwritten on a per binding basis for client, management and
# replication
# defaultSendBufferSize = "16M"

[network.gateway]

# Enables embedded gateway to start
# enabled = true
#
# Overrides the host the gateway binds to
# host = "localhost"
#
# Sets the port the gateway binds to
# port = 26500

[network.client]

# Allows to override the host the client api binds to
# host = "localhost"
#
# The port the client api binds to
# port = 26501
#
# Overrides the size of the buffer used for buffering outgoing messages to
# clients
# sendBufferSize = "16M"
#
# Sets the size of the buffer used for receiving control messages from clients
# (such as management of subscriptions)
# controlMessageBufferSize = "8M"

[network.management]

# Overrides the host the management api binds to
# host = "localhost"
#
# Sets the port the management api binds to
# port = 26502
#
# Overrides the size of the buffer to be used for buffering outgoing messages to
# other brokers through the management protocols
# sendBufferSize = "16M"
#
# Sets the buffer size used for receiving gossip messages and others
# receiveBufferSize = "8M"

[network.replication]

# Overrides the host the replication api binds to
# host = "localhost"
#
# Sets the port the replication api binds to
# port = 26503
#
# Sets the buffer size used for buffering outgoing raft (replication) messages
# sendBufferSize = "16M"

[network.subscription]

# Overrides the host the subscription api binds to
# host = "localhost"
#
# Sets the port the subscription api binds to
# port = 26504
#
# Overrides the size of the buffer to be used for buffering outgoing messages to
# other brokers through the subscription protocols
# sendBufferSize = "16M"
#
# Sets the buffer size used for receiving subscription messages and others
# receiveBufferSize = "8M"


[data]

# This section allows to configure Zeebe's data storage. Data is stored in
# "partition folders". A partition folder has the following structure:
#
# internal-system-0                 (root partition folder)
# ├── partition.json                (metadata about the partition)
# ├── segments                      (the actual data as segment files)
# │   ├── 00.data
# │   └── 01.data
# └── snapshots                     (snapshot data)
#

# Specify a list of directories in which data is stored. Using multiple
# directories makes sense in case the machine which is running Zeebe has
# multiple disks which are used in a JBOD (just a bunch of disks) manner. This
# allows to get greater throughput in combination with a higher io thread count
# since writes to different disks can potentially be done in parallel.
# directories = [ "data" ]

# The default size of data segments.
# defaultSegmentSize = "512M"

# How often we take snapshots of streams (time unit)
# snapshotPeriod = "15m"

# How often follower partitions will check for new snapshots to replicate from
# the leader partitions. Snapshot replication enables faster failover by
# reducing how many log entries must be reprocessed in case of leader change.
# snapshotReplicationPeriod = "5m"


[cluster]

# Allows to specify a list of known other nodes to connect to on startup
# The contact points of the management api must be specified.
# The format is [HOST:PORT]
# Example:
# initialContactPoints = [ "192.168.1.22:26502", "192.168.1.32:26502" ]
#
# Default is empty list:
# initialContactPoints = []

[threads]

# Controls the number of non-blocking CPU threads to be used. WARNING: You
# should never specify a value that is larger than the number of physical cores
# available. Good practice is to leave 1-2 cores for ioThreads and the operating
# system (it has to run somewhere). For example, when running Zeebe on a machine
# which has 4 cores, a good value would be 2.
#
# The default value is 2.
#cpuThreadCount = 2

# Controls the number of io threads to be used. These threads are used for
# workloads that write data to disk. While writing, these threads are blocked
# which means that they yield the CPU.
#
# The default value is 2.
#ioThreadCount = 2

[metrics]

# Path to the file to which metrics are written. Metrics are written in a
# text-based format understood by prometheus.io
# metricsFile = "metrics/zeebe.prom"

# Controls the interval at which the metrics are written to the metrics file
# reportingInterval = "5s"

[gossip]

# retransmissionMultiplier = 3
# probeInterval = "1s"
# probeTimeout = "500ms"
# probeIndirectNodes = 3
# probeIndirectTimeout = "1s"
# suspicionMultiplier = 5
# syncTimeout = "3s"
# syncInterval = "15s"
# joinTimeout = "1s"
# joinInterval = "5s"
# leaveTimeout = "1s"
# maxMembershipEventsPerMessage = 32
# maxCustomEventsPerMessage = 8

[raft]

# heartbeatInterval = "250ms"
# electionInterval = "1s"
# leaveTimeout = "1s"

# Configure exporters below; note that configuration parsing conventions do not apply to exporter
# arguments, which will be parsed as normal TOML.
#
# Each exporter should be configured following this template:
#
# id:
#   property should be unique in this configuration file, as it will server as the exporter
#   ID for loading/unloading.
# jarPath:
#   path to the JAR file containing the exporter class. JARs are only loaded once, so you can define
#   two exporters that point to the same JAR, with the same class or a different one, and use args
#   to parametrize its instantiation.
# className:
#   entry point of the exporter, a class which *must* extend the io.zeebe.exporter.Exporter
#   interface.
#
# A nested table as [[exporter.args]] will allow you to inject arbitrary arguments into your
# class through the use of annotations.
#
# An example configuration for a MongoDB exporter:
#
# [[exporter]]
# id = "MongoDB"
# jarPath = "exporters/myExporter.jar"
# className = "me.mustermann.mongodb.MongoDbExporter"
#   [exporter.args]
#   host = "localhost"
#   port = 21707
#
